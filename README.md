# (Unofficial) Decky JSAUX RGB Dock Control Plugin [![Chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20discord-7289da.svg)](https://deckbrew.xyz/discord)

This is an unofficial Decky plugin for controlling the JSAUX RGB docks.

Allows you to set some basic static colours or choose one of the pre-baked
RGB animations.

Tested on the HB1201S.

Developed by me, in my spare time, out of pure academic interest, with no
support or funding from JSAUX. However JSAUX (because I write tech reviews
for fun and giggles) *did* provide me with the HB1201S dock for free.

## Potential Roadmap

* Custom RGB colours
* Screen-dependent lighting effects
* Game artwork-dependent lighting effects?
